	/** Parallel Split Shadow Map (PSSM) shadow camera setup. 
	@remarks
    Ogre's LiSPSM algorithm makes buggy shadow frusta that often put high
    resolution areas in the wrong places. To fix this we subclass a new
    ShadowCameraSetup class that does not use LiSPSM.
    The solution to this problem in Ogre 2.1 was to derive from
    FocusedShadowCameraSetup instead of LiSPSMShadowCameraSetup.
    Instead, we are using a modified version of Focused shadow maps. Modified
    because we want the light's shadow frusta to always be z-up just like
    gazebo. The original Focused shadows in Ogre are y-up. Aligning shadow map
    frusta with the up direction tends to minimize shadow map stretching
    artifacts by letting stretched shadow texels form long rectangles instead
    instead of sawtooth patterns on most surfaces such as terrain and man-made
    objects.
  @note
    Because we are deriving from LiSPSM but not using all its functionality, the
    following member functions will have no effect: setOptimalAdjustFactor(),
    setUseSimpleOptimalAdjust(), setCameraLightDirectionThreshold().
